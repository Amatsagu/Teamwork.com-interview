Hi Krzysztof,

Our Developers reviewed your Go test and unfortunately, we are not going to proceed with your application further.
I have noted some feedback below - which we hope will be helpful for the future and provide some transparency.
The feedback is not bad at all - we're just lucky with the quality and quantity of candidates in our process.
I hope we can keep in touch for other roles in the future!


Feedback
- Considered different delimiter options
- Memory usage is controlled by reading CSV data line by line
- Solution works but might not be obvious how to run it
- There is no main file to run and execute the program, it is only done through tests
- Solution is only displayed by running the test, but you have to make sure to run it with -v flag otherwise you won't see the results
- Does not use idiomatic folder structure
- Unusual usage of types throughout the assignment
- ScanResult uses both value and pointer received methods, would be good to see comments why.
- Not idiomatic way of using a constructor with newScanResult
- Strange logic for finding email header with needFirstIteration, would be good to see comments and thought process around this logic


Kind regards,
TJ
